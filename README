[IDEA-Bug Report] module resolution failure in maven multi-module project

In a multi-module project, the main code in our integration module (used for testing) cannot depend upon test artifacts in other modules (even though it is defined as a compile scope in the pom.xml). The result is a failure to compile.  This works fine in 9.0.2 (IU-95.66) but fails in 9.0.3 (IU-95.429)

OS: Windows XP
JDK: JDK 1.6.0
